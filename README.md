What is Graphical Password Authentication? 
Graphical user authentication schemes typically require users to draw a secret on a background image or select images on a grid.
Although it is known that various image-related attributes affect security and memorability of generated passwords, current 
state-of-the-art approaches deliver image-content either randomly or based on the end-users' selections. Motivated by 
sociocultural theories which underpin that the meaning of an image varies across different people depending on their 
sociocultural background and experiences, in this paper we elaborate on a multi-layer image-content delivery approach 
which is supported by an initial framework that targets to deliver background images tailored to the unique sociocultural
experiences of users. By doing so, we aim to trigger the users' sociocultural episodic memories, and ultimately help the 
creation of more secure and memorable passwords. Initial experimental results related to the value of this approach are 
also presented.


The iOS App: 
I am currently building an iOS app to train users with Graphical Passwords, with the results from the user study we hope to see
that Graphical Passwords are a viable option for Password Security.
